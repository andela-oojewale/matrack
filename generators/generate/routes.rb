MatrackApp.router.draw do
  # Add different routes here.
  # You may specify the root route or landing page with the root keyword
  # The root method takes a parameter
  # EXAMPLE root "/" OR  root "controller#action"
  # Available routes requests are get, post, put and delete
  # Each takes in an alias the first parameter and a hash as the second
  # The hash key is "to" while the value is the controller and action
  # Example get "user", to: "sessions#index"
